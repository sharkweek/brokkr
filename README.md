
mechpy - a mechanical engineering toolbox

Forked from `nagordon`'s work at https://nagordon.github.io/mechpy.

TODO
 * [ ] create sphinx or mkdocs documentation
 * [ ] continue developing composites module
 * [ ] write applied engineering tutorials articles
 * [ ] clean up links in mechpy documentation
 * [ ] clean up mohr circle tutorial
 * [ ] consolidate fastener.py and bolt.py
 * [ ] clean up bolted_joints functions
 * [ ] implement typing module and type hinting for type checks. make sure to limit the Python version to 3.5+.
 * [ ] come up with a cleaner way to create the Laminate class using pandas
 * [ ] create BJSFM solution
 * [ ] PlyStress and PlyStrain may not be required if all simple matrix conversions are included in the Lamina class. Remove PlyStrain and PlyStress classes if this is the case.
 * [ ] Rewrite composites tools using Jones
 * [ ] Create interactive plots using plotly
 * [ ] Add ply failure criteria and indices to Lamina/Laminate classes
