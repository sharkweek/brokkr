This directory contains copies of Sphinx themes that do not come with
Sphinx itself or that are not required to be installed as a Python
package.

A demo of themes can be found at
http://hplgit.github.io/teamods/writing_reports/.

fenics - The official FEniCS web page layout (bootstrap based).
fenics_minimal1 - As fenics, but no explicit "FEniCS Project" in logo
  or other places, and all the navigation links to various FEniCS
  resources are removed.
fenics_minimal2 - As fenics_minimal1, but different logo.
fenics_classic - The old FEniCS web page layout (more colorful banner,
  not based on boostrap).
cbc - Red-ish theme for Center for Biomedical Computing, inspired by
  the classic Sphinx layout.
bloodish - A red-ish version of the classic Sphinx theme without
  navigation (much like cbc, but no logo and sidebar).
uio - Theme a la cbc but with University of Oslo red and black colors
  and right logo.
uio2 - Bootstrap-based theme (as fenics) with University of Oslo logo
  (same files as fenics_minimal, just the logos differ).

The rest of the themes here are hosted on the web.
