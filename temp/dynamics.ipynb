    "modal analysis is similar to frequency analysis. In frequency analysis a complex signal is resolved into a set of simple sine waves with individual frequency and amplitude and phase parameters. In modal analysis, a complex deflection pattern of a vibrating structure is resolved into a set of simple mode shapes with the same individual parameters. \n",

    "\n",
    "Most systems are actually multiple degrees of freedom (MDOF) and have some non-linearity, but can be simplified with a superposition of SDOF linear systems \n",

    "## Damping Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Where there is energy dissipation, there is damping. The system can be broken into the system inputs/excitation, a system G(s), and the output response, in Laplace or space\n",
    "\n",
    "The transfer function is a math model defining the input/output relationship of a physical system. Another definition is the Laplace transform ( $\\mathcal{L}$) of the output divided by the Laplace transform of the input. \n",
    "\n",
    "The frequency response function (FRF) is defined in a similar manner such that FRF is the fourier transform ($ \\mathcal{F} $) of the input divided by the fourier transform of the output\n",

    "## Modal Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "These relationships can be further explained by the modal test process. The measurements taken during a test are frequency response function measurements. The parameter estimation routines are curve fits in the Laplace domain and result in transfer functions.\n",

    "The signal-analysis approach is done by measuring vibration with accelerometers and determine the frequency spectrum. The other moethod is a system -analysis where a dual-channel FFT anlayzer is used to measure the ratio of the response to the input giving the frequency response function (FRF)\n",

    "a modal model allows the analysis of structural systems\n",
    "\n",
    "a mode shape is a deflection-pattern associated with a particular modal frequency or pole location. It is not tangible or easily observed. The actual displacement of the structure will be a sum of all the mode shapes. A harmonic exitation close to the modal frequency, 95% of the displacement may be due to the particular modeshape\n",

    " * Superposition of the component waves will result in the final wave. A swept sinosoid will give the same result as a broadband excitation\n",
    "\n",
    " * Homogeneity is when a measured FRF is independent of excitation level\n",
    "\n",
    " * Reciprocity implies that the FRF measured between any two DOFs is independent of which of them for excitation or response\n",
    "\n",
    " * small deflections - cannot predict buckling or catastrophic failure\n",
    "\n",
    " * casual - the structure will not vibrate before it is excited\n",
    "\n",
    " * stable - the vibrations will die out when the excitation is removd\n",
    "\n",
    " * time-invariant - the dynamic characteristics will not change during the measurments\n",
